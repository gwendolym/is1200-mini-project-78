This is a small game program that runs on a PIC32 Chipkit. It is a new take on the game snake, completely programmed in C and MIPS-Assembly. The game has two modes: Normal mode where the aim is to collect fruit while evading snakes that grow over time and endless mode where the aim is to survive as long as possible.

It was created for the course IS1200 Computer Hardware Engineering at KTH, that Hannah was later a teaching assistant in.
